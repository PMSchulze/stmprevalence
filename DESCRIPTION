Title: Inspect Relation between Prevalence Covariates and Topic Proportions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Patrick Schulze
Description: We implement the method of composition, where instead of an OLS regression,
    the user can choose between a quasibinomial GLM and a betaregression. 
    Furthermore, we provide functions to directly assess the relationship between
    prevalence covariates and topic proportions, by sampling from a logistic normal
    distribution with parameters from the stm output.
