Description: We implement the method of composition, where instead of OLS user can choose
    between a quasibinomial GLM and a betaregression. Furthermore, we provide functions to 
    directly asses the relationship between prevalence covariates and topic proportions,
    by sampling from a logistic normal distribution with parameters from stm output.
